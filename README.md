## Kaggle Competitions

Every now and then, I like to dip into **Kaggle competitions** when something interesting catches my eye. It's a nice way to explore different datasets and try out new ML approaches in a more relaxed setting. I find it helpful for staying curious about data science techniques and seeing how others approach problems, even if I'm not competing regularly.

## What I'm Working On

- Building scalable data pipelines and infrastructure using PySpark, Airflow, and modern data stack tools
- Exploring advanced ML techniques and data science methodologies
- Contributing to open source data engineering and ML projects
- Open to discussions about data engineering, ML, and open source collaboration
- Always interested in connecting with fellow data professionals and potential partners
